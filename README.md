# Discrete Optimization Code

This repo is made to stage the codes for the lecture series on discrete optimization avalable on coursera. It consists of:
* Greedy Algorithms
* Recursive Knapsack
* Branch and Bound Methods
* Mixed Integer Programming

The codes are uploaded weekly as the term progresses.
